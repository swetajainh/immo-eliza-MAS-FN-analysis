## Description

Pick out the properties that are the most valuable to the real estate company Immo Eliza and their clients.
Create a machine learning model to predict the prices of proporties across Belgium.

Make a preliminary analysis based on the dataset you previously scraped.
We have to answer two main questions:
- What are currently the most interesting insights about the Belgian real estate market?
- What variables are the most important when determining the price of a property?

## Repo Structure

https://github.com/realpython/rptree

In your data/ folder
 - Have a raw/ folder with the original dataset
 - Have a cleaned/ folder with the cleaned dataset
Make a clean.py script for any additional cleaning
Add your notebooks in an analysis/ folder
Put your finalized presentation in .pdf format in a reports/ folder

## Installation

### Step 1: Data Cleaning

Clean the collected data

<add some code>

### Step 2: Data Analysis

Analyse the cleaned data

Answer following questions (with a vizualization if appropriate):

- How many observations and features do you have?
- What is the proportion of missing values per column?
- Which variables would you delete and why?
- What variables are most subject to outliers?
- How many qualitative and quantitative variables are there? How would you transform the qualitative values into numerical values?
- What is the correlation between the variables and the price? Why do you think some variables are more correlated than others?
- How are the variables themselves correlated to each other? Can you find groups of variables that are correlated together?
- How are the number of properties distributed according to their surface?
- Which five variables do you consider the most important and why?
- What are the least/most expensive municipalities in Belgium/Wallonia/Flanders? (in terms of price per mÂ², average price, and median price)


### Step 3: Presentation
Communicate our analysis using simple words, clear graphs, and ideally also deliver a few recommendations.

Presentation plots should have:

- A clear title
- A legend (if applicable)
- Add axis labels (in understandable language, no variable names)
- Add axis units
- Have comparable scales
- Have no overlapping text
- A main takeaway
- Remove all clutter that doesn't contribute to the message
- Smart use of colors

Which insights did we found?

Which recommendations can we make?
    
## Functions

Use tools such as matplotlib, seaborn, plotly, or [insert whatever visualization tool you find useful]...

## Visuals

Posting your code is good, but putting a little preview in the form of a screenshot (or even just your application logo) is a small touch that goes a long way.

Adding a link to an online demo is even more stylish!
